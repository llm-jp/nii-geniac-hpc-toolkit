# CSP Tools for H100 Cluster validation using NCCL/DCGM.

This assumes that you are running on a Slurm login node that shares a filesystem
with the worker nodes, and that you have enroot/pyxis properly installed.

This is meant to mimic what is done
[here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Megatron-Launcher/tree/master/csp_tools)
by other CSPs.

To run the cluster validation, first import the container images for enroot to
use:

	./import_containers.sh

Then determine the nodes you want to validate (must be divisible by 2). Use
Slurm  to get the node lists:

	sinfo

This should return several lines, one of which might look something like

	a3*          up   infinite     40   idle dlvm-a3-ghpc-[0-39]

The `dlvm-a3-ghpc-[0-39]` string is what you care about, and it might be more
complicated like `dlvm-a3-ghpc-[0-9,11,23-39]`.

You'd then run:

	./cluster_validation.sh --nodelist "dlvm-a3-ghpc-[0-39]" --nodes 40 --partition a3

This will run both dcgm and nccl tests. To only run one or the other, supply
"--dcgm" or "--nccl", respectively.
